# Delivery System API v1
<p>The Delivery System APIs allow for the management and deployment of a group of files, called a repository.  These files are managed through REST APIs and through git.  These files are delivered, on every "git push", to players.brightcove.com.</p>
<p>If you haven't gone through the <a href="//docs.brightcove.com/en/video-cloud/players/guides/playertour.html">player tour</a>, it's highly suggested you start there.  You'll get security set up, learn some of the basics of the system, and then be ready to dive in further here.</p>
